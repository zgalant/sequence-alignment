    	        <h2>Sequence Alignment</h2>
    	        <h3>Background</h3>
    	        <p>
    	            Say you are given two sequences of DNA, RNA, or Proteins, and you want to find the similarity between the two of them. 
    	            Sequence Alignment is the method of finding similarity based on aligning two sequences together. Sequence alignment  
    	            takes two sequences and scores their similarity based on pairwise comparisons. The goal of sequence alignment is to 
    	            produce two sequences to maximize the similarity score. This may be done by inserting gaps into the sequences in order to 
    	            create more matches and eliminate more mismatches. 
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                When calculating the similarity score between two sequences, you assign a point value to each pair's similarity. 
	                In this example, we use a match score, a mismatch penalty, and a gap penalty. When comparing two sequences, one of 
	                these values is added to the similarity score for each pair.
	            </p>
	            <h3>Algorithm</h3>
	            <p>
	                There are several algorithms for aligning sequences. This site implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is a recursive 
	                algorithm based on dynamic programming. The algorithm works by considering the first character in each sequence. 
	                The algorithm has 3 choices:
	                <ol>
	                    <li>Match the two characters together</li>
	                    <li>Match the character from the first sequence with a gap</li>
	                    <li>Match the character from the second sequence with a gap</li>
	                </ol>
	                The algorithm tries each of these options and recurses on a shorter string. Once one of the sequences is empty, it knows the total score 
	                for this possible alignment. Since the algorithm tries all three cases, it exhaustively searches for the best score and updates 
	                when it is found.
	            </p>
	            <h3>Significance</h3>
	            <p>
	                Sequence alignment is very useful in bioinformatics for identifying similar sequences. Sequences that descend from a common ancestor 
	                are often analyzed to determine the evolutionary change that occurred. Also, alignment can be used to compare structural or functional 
	                relationships between sequences. 
	            </p>
